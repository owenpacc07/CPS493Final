# Fitness Tracker App
## Houses all the files for my final project for CPS493

Here are some features that the app must include.

  The ability for multiple users to log in. Each user must have their own experience.
      Their own data displayed to them. Including their name, etc. and their own activities log.
      Different users must have different access based on their roles.
      
  An admin area where users can be listed, added, edited, and deleted.
  
  An activity area where users can list, add, edit, delete activities.
  
  A friends area where users can see their friends activities, but not edit, or delete anything.
  
  Some kind of minimal statistics about their activity history.
